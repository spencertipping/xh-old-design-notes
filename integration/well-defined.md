# Integration is not well-defined
If the integral being evaluated takes its upper and lower limits as some sort
of time markers, then the partial ordering of the terms in the sum means that
the integral's value is not well-defined; you could get any of a few different
values by evaluating it.

I'm not sure this is a huge issue. A lot of functions don't have well-defined
values in common cases, and some of them underspecify the values they return.
Maybe it's not a problem after all.
